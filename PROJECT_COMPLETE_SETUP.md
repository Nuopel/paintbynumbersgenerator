## ⚠️ Critical Reminders

### For AI Manager
1. **LOT 1.2 is critical** - Establishes baseline for all testing
2. **LOT 3.3 needs extra scrutiny** - Most complex refactoring
3. **Never approve work that breaks snapshot tests**
4. **Quality over speed** - Request changes rather than approve substandard work

### For AI Devs
1. **Always read your LOT file completely before starting**
2. **Update PROJECT_TRACKER.md at start and completion**
3. **Run all tests before marking complete**
4. **Never regenerate snapshots without approval**
5. **Document any deviations in your LOT file**

## 🎓 What Makes This System Professional

✅ **Complete Scope Definition** - All work defined upfront
✅ **Clear Dependencies** - Know what blocks what
✅ **Validation Gates** - Quality checkpoints at each stage
✅ **Detailed Instructions** - No guesswork required

## 🏆 Project Quality Assurance

### Built-In Quality Controls
- Snapshot testing (proves no regressions)
- Performance benchmarks (±5% tolerance)
- Test coverage requirements (≥90%)
- Code quality validation (linting, strict TypeScript)
- Manager validation after each LOT
- End-to-end testing before delivery

### Risk Mitigation
- LOT 1.2 creates baseline before any refactoring
- LOT 3.3 marked as high-risk with extra validation
- Determinism testing ensures reproducibility
- Comparison tests (old vs new implementation)
- Multiple quality gates throughout project

## 📅 Typical Timeline

**If Working Sequentially:**
- Week 1: Phase 1 + Phase 2 (22h)
- Week 2-3: Phase 3 (32h)
- Week 4: Phase 4 + Phase 5 (26h)
- Week 5: Phase 6 (10h)

**Total: ~5 weeks @ 18h/week**

**If Multiple AI Devs:**
- Phases can overlap once dependencies complete
- Could finish in 3-4 weeks with parallel work
